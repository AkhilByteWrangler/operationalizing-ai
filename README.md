# Operationalizing AI: From Prototypes to Production

This repository contains a practical series focused on the operationalization of generative AI solutions. Each week introduces a self-contained, production-grade project that highlights core engineering, orchestration, and responsible AI principles using tools such as **Amazon Bedrock**, **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, **Docker**, and open-source LLMs.

These projects emphasize software engineering best practices, scalability, and responsible deployment, bridging the gap between AI research and real-world applications.
