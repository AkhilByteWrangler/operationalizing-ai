# Jokester Bot Frontend

This is a React frontend for Jokester Bot - a witty, over-the-top, and complicated answer machine! The bot answers any question (math, facts, advice, or jokes) in a highly entertaining, step-by-step, and always correct way.

## Features

- Dark-themed Bootstrap chat interface
- Fun, playful UI and bot personality
- Answers all questions with wit and humor
- Loading indicator for bot responses
- Conversation history

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. The app will open at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Configuration

- The frontend expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:5000/api/chat`.
- You can change the API endpoint in `src/App.js` if needed.

## How to Use

- Type any question or ask for a joke in the chat box.
- Jokester Bot will answer in a complicated, witty, and funny way (but always correct!).
- Type 'fact' for a fun fact.
